    ##Python multi-line continuation character
    '''
    Statements in python typically ends with a new line. However, python allows the use of line continuation character (\)
    that allows the line to continue.
    Statements between {},[] and () however don't need the character (\) to continue on to the next line
    The below statement works perfectly in Python..
    '''
    
    days =['Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday',
            'Thursday', 'Friday']

            and paragraph blocks in python
            '''
