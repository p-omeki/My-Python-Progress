#Accessing values in a string
#Quiz: Am trying to run this simple code from https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm and I can't get deeper understanding of it.
#This is the code, anyone with help can chip in. Below is the code:
var1 = "Hello World"
var2 = "Python Programming"

print , var1[0]
print , var2[1:5]
#When I run the code above, it gives no output. What might be wrong?
