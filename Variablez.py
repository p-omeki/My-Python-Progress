## Variables in a python are memory location used to store values in a python program
## Variables are first created then values are assigned to them.
## Creating a variable below;
name = "Patrick Meki" #Creating a string variable
year = 3 #Creating  an integer variable
study = 3.2 #Creating  a floating point value variable

print (name)

del (study) # Now, what this will do is that it will delete variable 'study' and if we try to print variable study it will bring an error!
