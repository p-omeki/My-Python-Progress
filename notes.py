 '''
The Tribranch is the feature branch of the main branch
    Now the code has two branches; tribranch and main branches

    ##Python multi-line continuation character
 '''
    Statements in python typically ends with a new line. However, python allows the use of line continuation character (\)
    that allows the line to continue.
    Statements between {},[] and () however don't need the character (\) to continue on to the next line
    The below statement works perfectly in Python..
    '''
    
 days =['Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday',
            'Thursday', 'Friday']
            
            
    ##Quotation and Comments in Python
 '''
    In python, there are 3 different types of quotation. Single (''), Double ("") and Triple(''' ''') quotes
    Check the examples below on quoatation in Python:
    '''
 word = 'Word'
 statement = "This is a statement"
 paragraph = '''This quote is used mostly in multi-line statements
            and paragraph blocks in python
            '''
    ##Comments
    #This statements is an example of a comments and it makes python codes to be easily readable to
    #humans. It also make it easy to understand code. Check example below:
            
    #First comment
 print ("Hello World") #Second comment
 #Python tuple and lists are similar, the only difference between the two is that 
 #~list are enclosed with brackets [] and it can be changed (elements) while tuple are 
 #~enclosed with parenthesis ()  and cannot be changed. Basically, tuples are 
 #~read-only lists.
 #The [] and () enclosers are only in the output.
 #Types of python operators
   '''
   1. Arithmetic operators - Includes the Addition(+), Substraction(-), Multiplication(*), Modulus(%),Exponent(**), Floor division(//), etc.
   2. Bitwise operators.
   3. Relational(Comparisson) operators - Includes Equal(==), Not equal(!=), Greater than(>), Less than (<), etc.
   4. Logical operators - Includes the Logical AND,OR or NAND
   5. Assignment operators  - Includes the (=), (+=), (-=), etc.

  #Decision makeing in Python
   '''
    Decision making in Python is the anticipation of condition when executing a program.
    In Python, there is the if statement, if else and the nested if statement.
    In if statement, can only be used when we want only to find a TRUE statement. If the condition is true, the compiler executes the conditional code and if not it jumps to produce a False output.
    In if else statement, can only be used when we want both TRUE and FALSE statement. If the condition is true, it executes the if statmt. and if false it execute the else statement.
    Also, there's the elif statement, similar to if else but it can only be used when we want to execute multiple TRUE statements.
    The major difference between elif statement and if  else statement is that elif can be used to execute multiple TRUE statement while if else can only be used when executing at most one statement...
    Lastly, the nested if sttmt., it used when executing an if statement inside another if statement. Basically, I would say it's a combination of if else and elif statement.
    Construct if...elif...else
